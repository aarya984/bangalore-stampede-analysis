# The Bangalore Breakdown – A Power BI Case Study

## 🌸 About This Project

This is not just a dashboard.  
It’s a story of lives lost in a crowd, and what we can learn from it.

I created this Power BI project to understand what went wrong during the **Bangalore stampede**. Using simulated data, I looked at:
- How the crowd was managed
- How the media reacted
- Who people blamed
- And what could have been done better

## 💭 Why I Made This

As a student, I wanted to work on something **real and meaningful**.  
So I chose a topic that really moved me a tragic event that could have been prevented.  
This project helped me see how powerful data can be when used with empathy.

## 🙋‍♀️ About Me

Hi! I'm **Aarya Walgaonkar**, an MCA student at MIT-WPU.  
I love making data dashboards that tell stories—especially ones that make people feel something or learn something new.

## 🌼 Final Note

This project is close to my heart.  
I hope it reminds us that data isn't just numbers—it's people, emotions, and real-life events.

Thank you for reading. 🤍
